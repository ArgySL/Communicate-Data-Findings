This dataset includes 800 Pokemon, in other words, 800 data observations, as well as eleven(11) features, at least one of which is categorical, and last, but not least, this is a tidy dataset (each variable is a column, each observation is a row). All the aforementioned characteristics of this dataset  are in adherence to the minimum requirements for a custom dataset required for this project. 

#: ID for each pokemon
 - Name: Name of each pokemon
 - Type 1: Each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks
 - Type 2: Some pokemon are characterized by two types
 - Total: The total sum of pokemon stats; an overview of how strong a Pokemon is
 - HP: Health Points, or Health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting
 - Attack: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch, Tackle, etc.)
 - Defense: the base damage resistance against normal attacks
 - SP Atk: special attack, the base modifier for attacks that generally don't require bodily contact (e.g. Flamethrower, Solarbeam, etc.)
 - SP Def: the base damage resistance against special attacks
 - Speed: determines which pokemon attacks first each round

Main findings:

1. The most common pokemon types(Water, Normal, Grass).
2. The vast majority of Pokemon in our data has a speed stat between fifty(50) and seventy(70).
3. The majority of the Pokemon of our data has a "special_attack" stat value of approximately between 37 and 72. 
4. The generation that introduced the least weak Pokemon is  the fifth one.
5. The generation that introduced the fastest Pokemon was the third one, Deoxys Speed Forme( very fragile!).
6. The fact that Legendary Pokemon are much more stronger than their non-legendary counterparts.
7. The fact that the fourth, and especially the second generation sport the weakest Special Attackers.
8. The fact that the strongest type is "Dragon" based on their total stats.
9. The fact that the strongest legendary Pokemon were introduced in the first and third generations.
10.The  fact that ten(10) of the cream of the crop Attacker Pokemon have over 150 Attack, while only eight(8)      Special    Attacker Pokemon have over 150 Special Attack, legendary Pokemon included.
11. The fact that there exist five(5) pokemon with "Very Fast" speed and way above average attack (over 150).


Main reason to include the findings included in Explanatory analysis:

The idea of fabricating a story of a Pokemon Trainer(Josh!) who wanted to increase his chances with a sole-Pokemon team against other trainers seemed fascinating to me.

No feedback was obtained for the Explanatory Analysis part of the project by the time of submission.
